# FFXIV Cutscene Reminder

Helpful little app to alert when a cutscene is about to end and display the countdown until its end.

# Usage

Should work in any modern browser as well as cellphones. Just select the duty you want alerts for, and then click the begin cutscene button each time a cutscene begins.
